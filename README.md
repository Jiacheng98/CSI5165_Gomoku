Introduction
------------

This project explores various Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that play Gomoku. In particular, the Minimax and Minima with Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms are utilized. In addition, this project proposes a heuristic evaluation function that assigns utility values to each game state. 
Heuristic evaluation functions with various parameters are also explored. 
Moreover, the project compares the performances of various AI agents against a baseline AI agent and a Minimax AI agent with a search depth of 1, respectively.


The main function can be found in main.py.
